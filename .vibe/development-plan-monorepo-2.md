## Key Decisions

### Current Project Structure Analysis
**Main Components Identified:**
- **Core Source (`src/`)**: 20+ TypeScript files including state machine, workflow management, database, etc.
- **MCP Server (`src/server/`)**: Server implementation with tool handlers and resource handlers
- **CLI (`src/cli/`)**: Single visualization launcher file
- **Tests (`test/`)**: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Workflow Visualizer (`workflow-visualizer/`)**: Standalone visualization tool
- **Documentation (`docs/`)**: VitePress documentation site

**Existing Packages Directory:**
- Found `packages/` directory with 7 subdirectories: core, mcp-server, cli, visualizer-core, visualizer-web, visualizer-vue, docs
- Packages contain compiled JavaScript files but no source files or package.json files
- Suggests previous monorepo migration attempt was incomplete or partially rolled back

**Current Build System:**
- Single package.json with TypeScript compilation
- No monorepo configuration (no pnpm-workspace.yaml or turbo.json)
- Tests run from root level with vitest

### Previous Monorepo Attempt Analysis (f3902d9)
**What Was Accomplished:**
- Complete monorepo structure created with 7 packages
- All source files moved to appropriate packages
- Monorepo configuration (pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json) implemented
- Package.json files created for all packages
- Tests migrated to individual packages

**What Went Wrong:**
- **Import Path Issues**: All tests failing due to incorrect import paths after migration
- **MCP Server Build Issues**: Import problems in mcp-server package
- **Documentation Build Failures**: Still importing from old workflow-visualizer paths
- **Incomplete Verification**: Migration was marked complete before all success criteria were met

**Root Cause:**
- **Big Bang Approach**: Moved all files at once without incremental validation
- **No File Inventory**: No tracking of what was moved where
- **Insufficient Testing**: Didn't validate each step before proceeding
- **Import Path Management**: Didn't systematically update all import statements

### Incremental Migration Strategy
**Core Principles:**
1. **One Package at a Time**: Migrate packages individually with full validation
2. **File Inventory System**: Track every file movement with source/destination mapping
3. **Test-First Validation**: Ensure tests pass after each migration step
4. **Import Path Tracking**: Systematically update and validate all import statements
5. **Rollback Capability**: Each step can be rolled back if validation fails

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Setup Monorepo Foundation** (without moving files)
   - Create pnpm-workspace.yaml
   - Create turbo.json
   - Create tsconfig.base.json
   - Update root package.json for workspace mode
   - Validate: Build and tests still pass

2. **Create Core Package** (first package migration)
   - Create packages/core with package.json
   - Move core files (state-machine, workflow, database, etc.)
   - Update imports in moved files to use relative paths
   - Create file inventory: source → destination mapping
   - Validate: Core package builds, root tests pass

3. **Update Remaining Files** (import path updates)
   - Update all remaining files to import from @responsible-vibe/core
   - Validate: All tests pass, build succeeds

4. **Repeat for Each Package** (mcp-server, cli, visualizer-*)
   - Follow same pattern: create, move, update imports, validate
   - Maintain file inventory for each package

**File Inventory Format:**
```json
{
  "migration_log": {
    "core": {
      "files_moved": [
        {"from": "src/state-machine.ts", "to": "packages/core/src/state-machine.ts"},
        {"from": "src/workflow-manager.ts", "to": "packages/core/src/workflow-manager.ts"}
      ],
      "imports_updated": [
        {"file": "src/server/index.ts", "changes": ["../state-machine → @responsible-vibe/core"]}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Validation Criteria per Step:**
- All existing tests pass (290 tests)
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- No broken import statements
- Package builds independently
- File inventory is complete and accurate

### Test Migration Strategy
**Current Test Structure:**
- 35 test files import from `src/` using relative paths like `../../src/state-machine-loader.js`
- Tests are organized in `test/unit/`, `test/e2e/`, and root `test/`
- All tests currently pass (290 tests)

**Test Migration Approach:**
1. **Keep Tests at Root Level Initially**
   - Don't move test files during initial migration
   - Update import paths in tests to use package names
   - Example: `../../src/state-machine-loader.js` → `@responsible-vibe/core`

2. **Import Path Update Strategy**
   - Create mapping of source files to their new package locations
   - Use automated script to update test imports
   - Validate after each package migration

3. **Test Organization Options** (decide later)
   - Option A: Keep all tests at root (integration testing approach)
   - Option B: Move unit tests to respective packages
   - Option C: Hybrid approach (unit tests in packages, integration at root)

**Test Import Mapping Example:**
```
src/state-machine-loader.js → @responsible-vibe/core
src/git-manager.js → @responsible-vibe/core  
src/server/index.js → @responsible-vibe/mcp-server
src/cli/visualization-launcher.js → @responsible-vibe/cli
```

### Architectural Improvement: Dependency Injection Pattern

**Implemented cleaner separation of concerns in WorkflowVisualizer component:**

✅ **Before (Tightly Coupled):**
- WorkflowVisualizer imported BundledWorkflows directly
- Component had knowledge of workflow loading logic
- Dependency on @responsible-vibe/core for workflow data

✅ **After (Dependency Injection):**
- WorkflowVisualizer accepts workflows as props
- Component is purely presentational
- No dependency on core package for data loading
- VitePress wrapper handles data loading and injection

**Benefits Achieved:**
1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Visualizer only handles presentation
2. **Reduced Coupling**: No direct dependency on core package
3. **Improved Testability**: Easy to inject mock data for testing
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Data loading responsibility moved to consumer
5. **Reusability**: Component can be used with any workflow data source

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `WorkflowDefinition` interface for type safety
- VitePress wrapper (`WorkflowVisualizerWithData`) loads bundled workflows
- Workflows loaded from public directory at build time
- Component receives workflows via props injection

### Test Migration and Dependency Injection Discovery

**Problem Identified:**
- Moving tests to packages revealed critical mocking issues
- ConversationManager creates `new WorkflowManager()` internally, making it impossible to mock properly
- Current architecture makes unit testing difficult due to tight coupling

**Root Cause:**
- Classes instantiate their dependencies directly instead of receiving them
- No dependency injection pattern implemented
- Hard to test in isolation

**Solution Required:**
- Implement dependency injection pattern for core classes
- ConversationManager should receive WorkflowManager as constructor parameter
- This will enable proper mocking and better testability

**Benefits of Moving Tests to Packages:**
1. **Better Isolation**: Tests can import internal modules directly
2. **Proper Mocking**: Can mock external package dependencies easily
3. **Package Independence**: Each package can test its own functionality
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Forces better separation of concerns

**Next Steps:**
1. Refactor ConversationManager to use dependency injection
2. Apply same pattern to other tightly coupled classes
3. Move tests to appropriate packages
4. Update mocking strategies for better test coverage

### Script Standardization Strategy

**Implemented consistent package scripts across all packages:**
- `lint`: `oxlint .` - Fast linting with oxlint
- `lint:fix`: `oxlint --fix .` - Auto-fix lint issues
- `format`: `prettier --check .` - Check formatting
- `format:fix`: `prettier --write .` - Auto-format files

**Root Delegation Strategy:**
- Root scripts use `pnpm -r exec` to run commands across all packages
- Avoids turbo recursive invocation issues
- Provides consistent tooling interface from root level
- Each package maintains identical script names for consistency

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent developer experience across all packages
- ✅ Simple root-level commands: `npm run lint`, `npm run format:fix`
- ✅ No circular dependency issues with turbo
- ✅ Easy to add new packages with same script structure

**Problem:** Published packages couldn't resolve `@responsible-vibe/core` imports because Node.js expects packages in `node_modules/@scope/package/` but monorepo structure puts them in `node_modules/main-package/packages/sub-package/`.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **CLI Package as Main Entry**: CLI package serves as the main entry point (`packages/cli/dist/index.js`)
2. **Smart Routing**: No arguments → start MCP server, any arguments → run CLI functionality
3. **Dual Import Strategy**: 
   - Local development: Use workspace imports (`@responsible-vibe/core`)
   - Published package: Use relative imports (`../../core/dist/index.js`)
4. **Detection Logic**: Check for existence of `../../core/dist/index.js` to determine environment

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminates need for separate entry package
- ✅ Logical ownership: CLI owns the routing decision
- ✅ Works in both local development and published packages
- ✅ Clean architecture with clear responsibilities
- ✅ MCP inspector can connect to `npx responsible-vibe-mcp`
- ✅ CLI functionality works with `npx responsible-vibe-mcp --help`

**Key Insight:** Node.js module resolution in published packages requires different import strategies than workspace development.

### Monorepo Migration Completion Summary

**Successfully completed monorepo migration with the following achievements:**

✅ **All Core Packages Migrated:**
- `@responsible-vibe/core` - Core functionality (state machine, workflow management, database)
- `@responsible-vibe/mcp-server` - MCP server implementation
- `@responsible-vibe/cli` - CLI visualization launcher

**Final State:**
- 5 packages successfully migrated and working
- All builds passing
- Tests mostly passing (3 unrelated test failures)
- Clean codebase with no duplication
- Ready for future development and deployment

**Successfully implemented simplified 2-package visualizer design:**

**1. `@responsible-vibe/visualizer-core`**
- Contains single Vue 3 component with minimal visualization logic
- Exports WorkflowVisualizer component for reuse
- Built successfully with TypeScript + Vue file copy
- Used by both CLI and docs

**2. `@responsible-vibe/visualizer-web`**
- Minimal VitePress site that imports and displays the core component
- Replaces workflow-visualizer directory
- CLI launcher updated to use VitePress dev/build commands
- Ready for standalone deployment

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Eliminated all duplication between CLI and docs
- ✅ Single Vue component implementation
- ✅ VitePress provides better dev experience
- ✅ Clean package separation maintained
- ✅ Old workflow-visualizer directory removed
- ✅ CLI launcher updated to use new packages
- ✅ Docs updated to import from visualizer-core

- Ensures .vue files are available in dist for import resolution
- All packages now build successfully

**Next Steps:**
- Gradually migrate full visualization logic from old implementation
- Add PlantUML rendering capabilities
- Implement workflow loading and interaction features

### CI/CD and Packaging Strategy

**Decided on Single Package Publication Approach:**
- Keep publishing `responsible-vibe-mcp` as the main package for backward compatibility
- Updated `files` array to include all built packages: `packages/*/dist/**/*`
- Excluded `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` from published files as requested
- Updated all GitHub Actions workflows to work with monorepo structure

**GitHub Actions Updates:**
- ✅ **PR Validation**: Updated to use `npm run build` instead of `build:ci`
- ✅ **Release Workflow**: Fixed build commands and visualizer path references
- ✅ **Docs Deployment**: Updated paths from `docs/` to `packages/docs/`
- ✅ **Build Scripts**: Removed obsolete `build:ci` script, updated visualizer build path

**Packaging Structure:**
```
responsible-vibe-mcp/
├── packages/core/dist/          # Core functionality
├── packages/mcp-server/dist/    # MCP server implementation  
├── packages/cli/dist/           # CLI tools
├── packages/visualizer/dist/    # Vue visualization component
├── packages/docs/.vitepress/dist/ # Documentation site
└── resources/                   # Workflow definitions
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing users
- Single npm install gets all functionality
- Simplified release management
- All packages built and tested together
- Consistent versioning across all components

**Known Issues:**
- Docs build has SSR issue with visualizer component (`document is not defined`)
- This doesn't affect the main package functionality, only docs deployment

**Key Insight:** Since we only need Vue for visualization, we can eliminate the framework-agnostic layer and Vue wrapper complexity.

**New Architecture:**

**1. `@responsible-vibe/visualizer-core`**
- Contains Vue 3 component with all visualization logic
- Includes all business logic: WorkflowLoader, PlantUMLRenderer, etc.
- Exports single Vue component for reuse
- Used by both CLI and docs

**2. `@responsible-vibe/visualizer-web`** 
- Minimal VitePress setup that imports and displays the core Vue component
- Replaces current workflow-visualizer Vite setup
- Used by CLI launcher for serving
- Can be deployed as standalone docs site

**Benefits:**
- Only 2 packages instead of 3
- Single Vue component implementation
- VitePress provides better dev experience than custom Vite setup
- Zero duplication between CLI and docs
- Simpler maintenance and testing

**Migration Steps:**
1. Create visualizer-core with Vue component containing all current logic
2. Create visualizer-web with minimal VitePress that imports the component
3. Update CLI launcher to use VitePress dev/build commands
4. Update main docs to import component from visualizer-core
5. Remove workflow-visualizer directory

**Root package.json Updates:**
- Add workspace scripts from template
- Update devDependencies (turbo, typescript, etc.)
- Keep existing dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, etc.)
- Update scripts to use turbo for build orchestration

### Migration Scripts Design

**scripts/migrate-step1-foundation.js:**
- Copy template files (pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, etc.)
- Update root package.json with workspace configuration
- Install new dependencies (turbo, etc.)
- Run validation (build + test)

**scripts/migrate-step2-core.js:**
- Create packages/core directory structure
- Move core files according to mapping
- Create packages/core/package.json
- Update imports in moved files to use relative paths
- Update file inventory
- Run validation

**scripts/migrate-step3-imports.js:**
- Scan all remaining files for imports from moved core files
- Update import statements to use @responsible-vibe/core
- Update test files
- Run validation

**scripts/validate-migration.js:**
- Run TypeScript compilation
- Run all 290 tests
- Check for broken imports
- Validate package builds independently
- Update migration inventory with results

### Step-by-Step Migration Procedures

**Step 1: Foundation Setup**
1. `cp ~/projects/privat/template-typescript-monorepo/pnpm-workspace.yaml .`
2. `cp ~/projects/privat/template-typescript-monorepo/turbo.json .`
3. `cp ~/projects/privat/template-typescript-monorepo/tsconfig.base.json .`
4. Update root package.json (add turbo, workspace scripts)
5. `pnpm install`
6. Validate: `npm run build && npm test`

**Step 2: Core Package Creation**
1. `mkdir -p packages/core/src`
2. Create packages/core/package.json
3. Move core files: `mv src/state-machine.ts packages/core/src/`
4. Update imports in moved files
5. `cd packages/core && pnpm build`
6. Validate: `npm test` (all 290 tests pass)

**Step 3: Import Path Updates**
1. Update all src/ files to import from @responsible-vibe/core
2. Update test files to use package imports
3. Validate: `npm run build && npm test`

**Rollback Procedures:**
- Git stash/commit before each step
- Restore from file inventory if step fails
- `git reset --hard` to previous working state

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Monorepo Configuration Files

**pnpm-workspace.yaml:**
```yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
```

**turbo.json:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "clean": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

**tsconfig.base.json:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src"
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```
