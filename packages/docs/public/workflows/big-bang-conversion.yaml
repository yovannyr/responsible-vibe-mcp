      - Performance requirements are met or exceeded
      - All external integrations work correctly
      - CONVERSION_PLAN.md is customized for your environment
      - Operations team is trained and ready
      - Rollback procedures are tested and ready

      **Final Deliverables:**
      - Fully functional new system with proven equivalence
      - Operational behavioral comparison mechanism
      - Comprehensive CONVERSION_PLAN.md for production execution
      - Validated rollback procedures
      - Ready operations team

      Update the plan file with readiness validation results and mark completed tasks.
