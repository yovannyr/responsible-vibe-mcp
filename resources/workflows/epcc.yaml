  commit:
    description: 'Code cleanup and documentation finalization'
    default_instructions: >
      You are in the commit phase. This phase ensures code quality and documentation accuracy through systematic cleanup and review.

      **STEP 1: Code Cleanup**
      Systematically clean up development artifacts:

      1. **Remove Debug Output**: Search for and remove all temporary debug output statements used during development.
         Look for language-specific debug output methods (console logging, print statements, debug output functions).
         Remove any debugging statements that were added for development purposes.

      2. **Review TODO/FIXME Comments**:
         - Address each TODO/FIXME comment by either implementing the solution or documenting why it's deferred
         - Remove completed TODOs
         - Convert remaining TODOs to proper issue tracking if needed

      3. **Remove Debugging Code Blocks**:
         - Remove temporary debugging code, test code blocks, and commented-out code
         - Clean up any experimental code that's no longer needed
         - Ensure proper error handling replaces temporary debug logging

      **STEP 2: Documentation Review**
      Review and update documentation to reflect final implementation:

      1. **Compare Against Implementation**: Review documentation against actual implemented functionality
      2. **Update Changed Sections**: Only modify documentation sections that have functional changes
      3. **Remove Development Progress**: Remove references to development iterations, progress notes, and temporary decisions
      4. **Focus on Final State**: Ensure documentation describes the final implemented state, not the development process
      5. **Verify Accuracy**: Ensure all examples, API descriptions, and usage instructions are accurate

      **STEP 3: Final Validation**
      - Run existing tests to ensure cleanup didn't break functionality
      - Verify documentation accuracy with a final review
      - Ensure code is ready for production/delivery

      Update the plan file with commit progress and mark completed tasks.
